# NOTES
---

1. API endpoints require an authorization header in the format `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. You should already have this token if you are developing for this API. Tokens will be different for every environment.
1. All examples in this document, including (but not limited to) authentication, request and response are just that - examples. They do not correspond to any real data on this server. Developers are expected to use real data and authentication.
1. The urls in this documentation are relative to this domain. If you are reading this on `http://xyz.com`, then append the relative url path `/path/to/endpoint` to get the final url i.e. `http://xyz.com/path/to/endpoint`.
