      <p class="intro-paragraph">Welcome to KidsClub! KidsClub is a community of parents who are interested in co-operative childcare. If you’re interested in swapping childcare with other parents, our site helps you find parents near you, schedule playdates with them, get to know them and their children, and build your network. Soon, we’ll be adding more structure for swapping drop-off childcare with other parents.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-2">Community Rules</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">All members are required to abide by our <a href="https://www.cottageclass.com/terms-of-service#">Terms of Service</a>, however, here is a brief summary of some guidelines we’ve put in place to keep our community strong. Above all&mdash;to have the best experience on KidsClub&mdash;be kind and respectful, and treat others as you’d wish to be treated!</p>
      <div class="question">When attending a playdate:</div>
      <ul class="unordered-list">
        <li class="ul-item">Don’t bring a sick child. If your child is feeling ill, we can certainly let you choose another date! The same goes for hosting. If your child isn’t feeling well, it’s fine to cancel! We can help your guests get rescheduled for another date.</li>
        <li class="ul-item">Make sure to RSVP every child who is attending. If you bring an extra child that you haven’t signed up, it can put your host in an awkward position.</li>
        <li class="ul-item">If the host has a dog, confirm with them that their pooch will be safely separated from the children (behind a closed door) for the duration of the playdate.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="question">When hosting a playdate:</div>
      <ul class="unordered-list">
        <li class="ul-item">As parents sign up for your playdate, we’ll send you information about the families attending via email. Please let us know if you have any questions or need any additional information about the families attending.</li>
        <li class="ul-item">When families RSVP, you’ll receive a text message notifying you. You can decline any guest within 24 hours—otherwise the booking will be confirmed. If you have any concerns about a guest, please let us know and we’ll work with you to find a solution.</li>
        <li class="ul-item">If you have a dog, be sure to keep them safely separated from the children (behind a closed door) for the duration of the playdate.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="question">Policy of Nondiscrimination, Inclusion, and Respect:</div>

        <p class="paragraph">Our basic human need to care for our young - to guide them and provide them with safe, social spaces - transcends epoch, region, and culture. To fulfill this need, CottageClass Inc. (“CottageClass,” “we” or “us”) is bringing together a community of parents and teachers from a wide array of backgrounds, belief systems, and life experiences to exchange the gift of childcare and education. By joining our community, as an employee or as a parent or teacher who uses our platform, we agree to abide by the fundamental principles of inclusion, respect, and fairness that make this exchange possible. That means upholding these values in how we design our platform, how we hire and work with employees, and the values we seek to foster in our parent community. It is precisely our differences that make us powerful, that help us support our children to become tomorrow’s global citizens.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Beyond merely prohibiting illegal forms of bias, we want to actively work towards a culture of respect, inclusion, and fairness. Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and the persecution of immigrants have no place on our platform or in our community, nor does any other form of unreasoning fear, bias, or hatred. All of our employees, parents and teachers agree to read and fulfill the letter and spirit of this policy in their speech and behavior towards others. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Parents or Teachers may not decline or place special restrictions on a parent or student based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, immigration or citizenship status, gender identity, or marital status. We respect the right of parents and teachers on our platform to decline parents or students for any other reason not enumerated in this policy. When a parent or student is declined or otherwise turned away, it creates the possibility for a member of our community to feel excluded and unwelcomed, and as such our policy seeks to balance the prerogatives of the parent or teacher with the rights of the parent and student. Parents or Teachers who demonstrate a pattern of rejecting parents or students in a protected class will be subject to review and possible suspension from the platform. Conversely, parents who display disrespectful, bigoted, or otherwise discriminatory behavior will likewise be subject to review and possible suspension. We hold ourselves, our employees, and the parents and teachers who use our platform to the same high standard: to imagine a world where all children thrive in environments free from prejudice and hate. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Nothing in this policy should be construed as requiring parents and teachers to violate applicable laws or take actions that may subject them to legal liability. When in doubt, you can always reach out to us directly for additional guidance. </p>

      <h2 class="heading-2">General Questions</h2>
      <div class="question">How does it work? </div>
      <ul class="unordered-list">
        <li class="ul-item">On KidsClub, making new friends and sharing childcare is free!</li>
        <li class="ul-item">When you plan your first playdate with a family, we strongly encourage you to stay with your child and get to know the family. You can choose to swap childcare whenever you're both comfortable doing so.</li>
        <li class="ul-item">You can edit or change your playdate at any time, though we request 24 hours notice as a courtesy to other families.</li>
        <li class="ul-item">Your playdate can be as simple as playing with toys, or you can go all out and host a creative arts project or a robotics class!</li>
        <li class="ul-item">If you can't find a playdate at a time that works for you, you can also reach out to parents individually to set up a playdate.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="question">What if I’m the first person to join in my neighborhood?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">KidsClub is set up to support you in sharing childcare wherever you live! All you have to do is host a playdate, invite friends, classmates and/or people in your local parent groups. Once they RSVP to your playdate, they’ll be prompted to reciprocate by hosting playdates of their own and inviting their friends. Before you know it, you’ll have a thriving group of amazing parents sharing care!</p>
      <div class="question">Can I join if I’m not a parent?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">No. KidsClub is a community to encourage parents to share childcare and educational activities with other parents to build community, save money and get access to the highest quality care. If you’re not a parent and would like to offer a paid or a free offering, we encourage you to visit our sister platform, <a href="https://www.cottageclass.com/teach">CottageClass</a> to share your offering!</p>
      <div class="question">How do I contact you?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">Please call us at 862-294-4859 if you have any questions at all! Our email is <a href="mailto:contact@cottageclass.com">contact@cottageclass.com</a></p>

  <div id="Hosting-Playdates" class="section f6f6f6">
    <div class="lp-container w-container">
      <h2 class="heading-2">Hosting Playdates</h2>
      <div class="question">How do I set up a playdate?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">First, click "Offer playdate", describe your playdate, and pick some times you are available. Then, either find a scheduled playdate near you, or reach out to some parents with similarly-aged children near you and invite them to your playdate. If you have friends who you might like to swap childcare with, we encourage you to invite them too!</p>
      <div class="question">How do I invite my friends and my child’s classmates to share childcare with me?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">KidsClub makes sharing care with friends easy! All you have to do is invite your friends to your playdate or to join KidsClub. When they RSVP to your playdate, they’ll get prompted to create a playdate of their own and invite you!</p>
      <div class="question">Can I control who attends my playdate?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">You have the right to accept or decline any family that RSVP’s to your playdate. You will receive a notification if a family RSVP’s. If you do not reply within 24 hours, their booking will be confirmed. So it is important to reply promptly with any questions or concerns about an RSVP.</p>
      <div class="question">What should I offer on my playdate?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">It's up to you! Some parents choose to offer a simple activity and sometimes a meal or snack, but it's your choice. Your playdate can be very easygoing. For a group of children, a snack and a movie are a great place to start. For two or three children, just letting them play and get to know each other is great! If you’re inspired, you are also welcome to design a more elaborate event, such as a painting party or a robotics workshop, but this is by no means expected or required.</p>
      <div class="question">What if no one RSVP’s to my playdate?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">That's alright! Just by making your playdate available as an option to parents, you're helping our community create childcare availability and coverage for as many children at as many times as possible. That said, we know it's more fun when playdates are well-attended. The best ways to ensure people come to your playdate is to share it widely to friends and local parent groups.</p>
      <div class="question">How long are playdates?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">It's up to you and the other parents! We recommend 1-2 hours for a first playdate.</p>
      <div class="question">What if I need to cancel or reschedule my playdate?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">It’s fine to reschedule or cancel your playdate, and you can do so <a href="/your-playdates">here</a> by pressing "cancel" on each playdate. We understand that being a parent puts you on a busy and sometimes messy schedule. If you do need to cancel or reschedule, please try to do with as much advance notice as possible.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-2">Attending Playdates</h2>
      <div class="question">How do I book a playdate?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">You book your playdate by clicking "Going" to any of the events on the events page, or by reaching out to a family directly. When you book your playdate, you’ll get an automated text message from the KidsClub team confirming your reservation.</p>
      <div class="question">Can a family decline my request?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">The family hosting the event has 24 hours to decline your request in case they cannot accommodate you, otherwise you are good to go! We will do our best to find you another option should this occur.</p>
      <div class="question">What if I need to cancel or reschedule my playdate?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">You can cancel at any time by clicking "cancel" <a href="/your-playdates">here</a>, but please try to give your host 24 hours notice.</p>

  <div id="Trust-Safety" class="section f6f6f6">
    <div class="lp-container w-container">
      <h2 class="heading-2">Trust and Safety</h2>
      <div class="question">How do I ensure my child is safe on my playdate?</div>
      <ul class="unordered-list">
        <li class="ul-item"><strong>Stay with your child until you're comfortable sharing care.</strong> You're always free to stay with your child to get to know a new family, and you should only share childcare once you're both comfortable doing so.</li>
        <li class="ul-item"><strong>Get a background check through KidsClub.</strong> Parents who have purchased background checks get a “background check” badge on their profile. This is a great way to ensure our community stays safe and by going through a background check yourself, you help other parents make sure their child is safe. Background checks cost $50-100 depending on what state you live in. Email <a href="mailto:contact@cottageclass.com">contact@cottageclass.com</a> to inquire about getting a background check.</li>
        <li class="ul-item"><strong>Message new friends.</strong> If you’d like to broaden your friend network, we encourage you to message people you don’t know on the platform and get together for a playdate. You can also propose to get together with your kids in a public place like the library or the park before you start booking care with that person! Approach playdates on KidsClub the way you'd approach playdates with a new classmate, say. First get to know the family, then go from there.</li>
        <li class="ul-item"><strong>Host a mixer.</strong> Have a meetup at the local coffee shop or a potluck and invite parents who live near you.</li>
        <li class="ul-item"><strong>Host a playdate.</strong> Hosting a playdate is a great way to meet new friends that you’d like to book care with down the road.</li>
        <li class="ul-item"><strong>Invite your friends to share care with you.</strong> A great place to start is sharing childcare with your existing friends and other parents in your child’s class and school. We depend on you to invite amazing people to join KidsClub. We encourage you to invite only friends you know and trust to join the platform. When you attend their activity, you’ll get to know their friends as well and broaden your network!</li>
        <li class="ul-item"><strong>Review profiles.</strong> If your host is a stranger, we also encourage you to look at reviews of your host and information they have provided on their profile such as job title, employer and the schools their children attend. You can also see who has purchased a background check. Soon we'll be adding other features, such as additional profile information, mutual friends and more.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="question">What should I do if I have concerns about a guest or host?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">Please reach out to us <strong>immediately</strong> at <a href="mailto:contact@cottageclass.com">contact@cottageclass.com</a> if you have any concerns about your host that you don’t feel comfortable voicing publicly. It’s important to us to understand everything that’s going on so we can diplomatically address any concerns with the host. In some cases, if necessary, we may ask people to leave the platform. Likewise, if you have concerns about a member you have hosted or otherwise met on the platform, please reach out to us at any time with private feedback.</p>
      <div class="question">How do I offer suggestions on how to make KidsClub better?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">After your playdate, we will send you a survey to see how things went! We rely on your feedback to improve this experience and make it a truly useful tool for families in the community to share care, so please don’t hold back.</p>
      <div class="question">How do reviews work?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">After your playdate, we will also ask you to leave an honest review of your host. Please do sing their praises if the experience was positive. Your review is a great asset to other parents seeking quality care! If a host receives negative feedback, the KidsClub team will review their case and decide whether to keep them on the platform or remove them.</p>
      <div class="question">Is my phone number visible to other users?</div>
      <p class="paragraph">Not until one of you RSVPs to the other's playdate, at which point we email you each other's phone numbers in case you need them for scheduling or emergencies. Messages sent through the site pass through a proxy that hides each person's real phone number.</p>
